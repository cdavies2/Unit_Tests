13. **eBay Data Breach (2014)**: Hackers stole sensitive information, including names, addresses, and dates of birth, of over 145 million customers from the online marketplace eBay.
14. **Anthem Data Breach (2015)**: Hackers stole sensitive information, including Social Security numbers and medical IDs, of over 78 million customers from the health insurer Anthem.
15. **Uber Data Breach (2016)**: Hackers stole sensitive information, including names, email addresses, and phone numbers, of over 57 million customers and drivers from the ride-hailing company Uber.

These incidents highlight the importance of cybersecurity and the need for individuals and organizations to take measures to protect themselves from cyber threats.
This is the response from the  model: 
 The most recent incident from the list is the Uber Data Breach in 2016. However, it was not publicly disclosed until 2017. The most recent incident that was publicly disclosed in the same year as it occurred is the NotPetya Ransomware Attack in 2017.
This is the response from the  model: 
 The NotPetya Ransomware Attack used a combination of tactics to infect computers and cause widespread disruption. Here are some of the tactics used:

1. **Phishing Emails**: The attack began with phishing emails that appeared to be from a Ukrainian accounting software company called M.E.Doc. The emails contained a malicious attachment that, when opened, would infect the computer with the NotPetya ransomware.
2. **Exploiting Vulnerabilities**: The ransomware exploited a known vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows operating system (MS17-010) to spread from infected computers to others on the same network.
3. **Lateral Movement**: Once inside a network, the ransomware would move laterally, infecting other computers and servers on the network.
4. **Encryption**: The ransomware encrypted the hard drives of infected computers, making them inaccessible to the users.
5. **Disguise**: The ransomware was disguised as a legitimate version of the Petya ransomware, which had been used in previous attacks. However, it was later discovered that NotPetya was not designed to be a traditional ransomware and did not have a decryption key. Instead, it was designed to cause widespread disruption and destruction.
6. **Wiper Malware**: Some experts believe that NotPetya may have also contained elements of wiper malware, which is designed to destroy data rather than encrypt it for ransom.

The NotPetya attack was highly destructive and caused significant disruption to businesses and organizations around the world, with estimated damages of over $10 billion. It is considered one of the most damaging cyberattacks in history.
This is the response from the  model: 
 If the NotPetya attack occurred today, there are several ways in which the tactics used might be different:

1. **Phishing Emails**: Phishing emails are still a common tactic used by cybercriminals, but they are becoming more sophisticated and harder to detect. Today, attackers may use more convincing email tactics, such as spoofing the email address of a trusted sender, using social engineering techniques to trick users into clicking on malicious links, or using advanced techniques to evade email filters.
2. **Exploiting Vulnerabilities**: Microsoft released a patch for the vulnerability exploited by NotPetya (MS17-010) in March 2017, before the attack occurred. Today, organizations are more likely to have implemented patch management programs to ensure that their systems are up-to-date and protected against known vulnerabilities.
3. **Lateral Movement**: Lateral movement is still a common tactic used by attackers, but today's networks are more complex and have more security measures in place to prevent lateral movement. For example, network segmentation can help to limit the spread of malware within a network, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools can help to detect and respond to threats more quickly.
4. **Encryption**: Ransomware attacks are still a threat today, but many organizations have implemented backup and recovery strategies to minimize the impact of ransomware attacks. This includes regularly backing up data to offline storage, using cloud-based backup solutions, and implementing data encryption to protect data at rest and in transit.
5. **Disguise**: Today's ransomware is often more sophisticated and harder to distinguish from legitimate software. Attackers may use techniques such as polymorphic malware, which changes its code each time it is executed, making it harder to detect and analyze.
6. **Wiper Malware**: Wiper malware is still a threat today, and attackers may use it in combination with ransomware or as a standalone attack. Today's wiper malware is often more sophisticated and harder to detect, and it can cause more damage to systems and data.

Overall, while the tactics used in cyberattacks may evolve over time, organizations can take steps to protect themselves by implementing strong security measures, staying up-to-date with the latest threats, and educating employees about the risks and best practices for cybersecurity.
