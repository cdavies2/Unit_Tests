They can do this by crafting a malicious prompt, which might look like this:\\n```sql\\n' OR 1=1 --\\n```\\nLet's break down what this prompt does:\\n\\n* `OR 1=1` is the malicious part. This is a common technique used in SQL injection attacks, as it always returns `true` in a database query, allowing the attacker to bypass any filtering or validation.\\n* `--` is the prompt, which is a special character in SQL that indicates the end of the prompt.\\n\\n**How it works:**\\n\\n1.
