 The security measures faced by the bank robbers I mentioned in my previous response were significantly different from those in place today. In the early 20th century, banks were often not as secure as they are today, with many lacking sophisticated security systems such as cameras, alarms, and armed guards. Bank robbers were able to use a variety of tactics to gain entry to banks and escape with large sums of money, such as drilling through walls, using explosives, and disguising themselves as bank employees.

In contrast, modern banks have implemented a wide range of security measures to deter and prevent robberies. These measures include:

1. Security cameras: Banks now have multiple cameras installed throughout the premises, both inside and outside, to monitor activity and deter potential robbers.
2. Alarms: Banks have alarms that are triggered when a door or window is forced open or when a large amount of cash is removed from the vault.
3. Armed guards: Many banks employ armed guards to protect the premises and respond to any security breaches.
4. Vaults: Modern vaults are much more secure than those of the past, with thicker walls, reinforced doors, and advanced locking mechanisms.
5. Cash handling procedures: Banks have strict procedures in place for handling cash, such as counting and verifying cash in the presence of a witness, to prevent theft.

Newer tactics may be more appealing to bank robbers because they are more difficult to detect and require less planning and resources. For example, cybercrime has become a growing concern for banks, with hackers using sophisticated methods to steal money electronically. This type of crime is less risky and less likely to result in physical confrontations with law enforcement. Additionally, the use of technology has made it easier for criminals to research and plan their crimes, making it easier to identify vulnerabilities in bank security systems.

 I am happy to help with that! Some famous examples of American bank robbers include:

1. John Dillinger: Known as the "Public Enemy No. 1" during the Great Depression, Dillinger robbed banks and police stations in the Midwest. He was eventually shot and killed by FBI agents in 1934.
2. Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow: This infamous duo, along with their gang, robbed banks and gas stations across multiple states during the 1930s. They were eventually ambushed and killed by law enforcement in 1934.
3. Jesse James: A notorious outlaw and bank robber during the Reconstruction era, James and his gang robbed banks and trains in Missouri and other states. He was eventually shot and killed by a former member of his gang in 1882.
4. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid: This pair of outlaws, along with their gang, robbed banks and trains in the Western United States during the late 1800s. They are believed to have fled to South America after a failed bank robbery in 1901.
5. Willie Sutton: Known as the "Sultan of Sleaze," Sutton was a prolific bank robber who operated in the Eastern United States during the 1930s and 1940s. He was eventually caught and served multiple prison sentences.
6. Alvin Karpis: Known as the "Pigmeat" gang's leader, Karpis was a bank robber and kidnapper who operated in the Midwest during the 1930s. He was eventually caught and served a lengthy prison sentence.
7. Baby Face Nelson: A violent bank robber and gangster during the 1930s, Nelson was a member of John Dillinger's gang and was known for his ruthless tactics. He was eventually shot and killed by FBI agents in 1934.

 The actions of the most recent bank robber on the list I provided were those of Willie Sutton, who operated in the 1930s and 1940s. Sutton was successful because he was a highly skilled and experienced bank robber who was able to evade capture for many years. He was known for his ability to blend in with the crowd and avoid suspicion, and he often targeted banks that were poorly guarded or had weak security measures in place. Additionally, Sutton was able to stay one step ahead of law enforcement by constantly changing his appearance and moving around frequently. He was eventually caught and served multiple prison sentences, but his reputation as a successful bank robber endured.

 The security measures faced by the bank robbers mentioned in my previous response were significantly less sophisticated than those in place today. In the 1930s and 1940s, banks often had minimal security measures such as simple locks on the doors and windows, and there were no cameras or alarms to deter would-be robbers. Additionally, law enforcement agencies were not as well-equipped or organized as they are today, making it easier for robbers to evade capture.

In contrast, modern banks have a wide range of security measures in place to deter and prevent robberies. These measures include:

1. Security cameras: Banks have multiple cameras installed throughout the premises to monitor activity and record footage of any suspicious behavior.
2. Alarms: Banks have alarms on doors and windows that are triggered if they are forced open.
3. Vaults: Banks have secure vaults where cash and other valuable items are stored. These vaults are often made of reinforced concrete and have multiple locks and other security features.
4. Armed guards: Banks often employ armed guards to protect the premises and deter would-be robbers.
5. Cash transport vehicles: Banks use armored vehicles to transport cash to and from the bank, and these vehicles are equipped with security features such as bulletproof glass and reinforced walls.

Newer tactics may be more appealing to bank robbers because they are more difficult to detect and are less likely to result in capture. For example, cybercrime has become a growing concern for banks, as hackers can steal large amounts of money without physically entering the bank. Additionally, some robbers may use distraction tactics, such as setting off a fire alarm or causing a scene, to divert attention away from the actual robbery. These tactics are more difficult for banks to prevent, as they require a different approach to security.

 The security measures faced by the bank robbers I mentioned, such as Willie Sutton, were significantly different from those in place today. In the 1930s and 1940s, banks often had minimal security measures, such as a single guard and a simple lock on the door. This made it easier for robbers to gain entry and make off with large amounts of cash.

In contrast, modern banks have much more sophisticated security measures in place, such as surveillance cameras, alarms, and armed guards. Additionally, banks now use electronic systems to track and secure their money, making it much more difficult for robbers to make off with large sums of cash.

Newer tactics may be more appealing to bank robbers because they are designed to bypass or exploit these modern security measures. For example, some robbers may use technology to hack into bank systems and transfer money electronically, rather than physically stealing cash. Others may use distraction tactics, such as setting off a fire alarm or causing a scene, to divert attention away from the actual robbery. Still others may use weapons or threats to intimidate bank employees and force them to cooperate.

Overall, the tactics used by bank robbers have evolved over time to reflect the changing security measures in place at banks. As banks continue to improve their security, robbers will likely continue to adapt and develop new tactics to try to outsmart them.
