 I am happy to help with that! Some famous examples of American bank robbers include:

1. John Dillinger: Known as the "Public Enemy No. 1" during the Great Depression, Dillinger robbed banks and committed other crimes from 1933 to 1934.
2. Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow: This infamous duo, along with their gang, robbed banks and gas stations in the 1930s. They were known for their violent crimes and were eventually killed in a shootout with law enforcement.
3. Jesse James: A notorious outlaw and bank robber during the Reconstruction era, James and his gang robbed banks and trains in the Midwest.
4. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid: This pair of outlaws were known for their bank robberies and train heists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They are believed to have escaped to South America after a failed bank robbery in 1901.
5. Willie Sutton: Known as the "Sultan of Sleaze," Sutton was a prolific bank robber who was active from the 1930s to the 1950s. He was eventually caught and served multiple prison sentences.

 The actions of the most recent bank robber on the list I provided were those of Willie Sutton, who was active from the 1930s to the 1950s. Sutton was successful because he was a highly skilled and experienced bank robber who was able to evade capture for many years. He was known for his meticulous planning and execution of his crimes, as well as his ability to blend in with the general population and avoid suspicion. Sutton was eventually caught and served multiple prison sentences, but he remained a notorious figure in the annals of American crime.

 The security measures faced by the bank robbers I mentioned in my previous response were significantly different from those in place today. In the early 20th century, banks were often less secure and had fewer security measures in place, such as cameras, alarms, and armed guards. Bank robbers were able to use a variety of tactics to gain entry to banks and escape with large sums of money, such as drilling through walls, using explosives, and disguising themselves as bank employees.

In contrast, modern banks have significantly more security measures in place, such as cameras, alarms, armed guards, and advanced security systems. These measures make it much more difficult for bank robbers to gain entry to banks and escape with large sums of money. As a result, newer tactics may be more appealing to bank robbers, such as cybercrime, which allows them to access bank accounts and transfer funds without physically entering a bank. Additionally, the use of technology and the internet has made it easier for bank robbers to research and plan their crimes, as well as to communicate with each other and coordinate their activities.
