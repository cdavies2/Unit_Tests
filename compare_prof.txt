This is the response from the normal model: 
 Prompt injection refers to the act of maliciously modifying the input provided to an AI model or system, with the intention of manipulating its output or behavior. This can be done by inserting additional text or commands into the original prompt, often in a way that is not immediately noticeable.

For example, in the context of a chatbot, a user might attempt to prompt injection by adding hidden commands or instructions within a seemingly innocuous question or statement. The goal is to make the AI model respond in a way that was not intended by the original designers, potentially leading to unintended consequences or security vulnerabilities.

Prompt injection can be a concern for developers and users of AI systems, as it can be used for various malicious purposes, such as gaining unauthorized access, spreading misinformation, or causing disruptions. To mitigate this risk, it's important for AI systems to have robust security measures in place, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent or detect prompt injection attempts.
This is the response from the modified model: 
 Prompt injection, in the context of natural language processing (NLP) and conversational AI, refers to the malicious manipulation of input data to influence the output of a model. This manipulation is achieved by inserting specific, often hidden, patterns or sequences of text within the input that the model is not designed to handle, leading to unintended or undesirable responses.

For instance, an attacker might inject a sequence of words that the model interprets as a command or instruction, causing the model to generate an inappropriate or incorrect response. This can be particularly problematic in applications where the model's output is used to make decisions or provide information to users.

Prompt injection attacks can be mitigated through various techniques, such as input validation, sanitization, and the use of robust models that are less susceptible to such manipulations. However, as NLP models become more complex and sophisticated, so too do the methods used by attackers to exploit them, making continuous research and development in this area essential.
