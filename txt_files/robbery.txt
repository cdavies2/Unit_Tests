 I can provide some examples of infamous American bank robbers. Here are a few:

1. John Dillinger: Known as "Public Enemy No. 1" during the Great Depression, Dillinger robbed banks and committed other crimes from 1933 to 1934.

2. Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow: This notorious duo, along with their gang, committed numerous robberies, murders, and other crimes in the 1930s.

3. Jesse James: A notorious outlaw and gang leader in the post-Civil War era, James and his brother, Frank James, were known for their bank and train robberies.

4. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid: This pair, along with their Wild Bunch gang, were known for their train and bank robberies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

5. Willie Sutton: Active in the 1930s and 1940s, Sutton was known for his numerous bank robberies. When asked why he robbed banks, he reportedly replied, "Because that's where the money is."

6. Alvin Karpis: Known as "Creepy Karpis," he was a member of the Ma Barker gang and was one of the longest-serving prisoners in the federal prison system.

7. Charles Arthur "Pretty Boy" Floyd: Active during the Great Depression, Floyd was known for his bank robberies and was considered a Robin Hood figure by some.

8. Baby Face Nelson: A violent criminal, Nelson was a member of John Dillinger's gang and was known for his bank robberies and shootouts with law enforcement.

 The actions of the last robber I mentioned, Baby Face Nelson, were the most recent among the robbers I listed. Nelson was active during the 1930s, specifically from 1933 to 1934.

Nelson was successful in part because he was a skilled marksman and was willing to use violence to escape from law enforcement. He was also a member of John Dillinger's gang, which was notorious for its bank robberies and evasion of the law. Nelson was known for his ability to change his appearance quickly, making it difficult for authorities to identify him.

However, it's important to note that Nelson's criminal career was short-lived. He was killed in a shootout with FBI agents in 1934. Despite his successes, his violent and unpredictable behavior ultimately led to his downfall.

 The security measures and tactics used by the bank robbers I mentioned, such as John Dillinger, Bonnie and Clyde, Jesse James, Butch Cassidy, and Baby Face Nelson, were significantly different from those used today. At that time, banks were not as heavily fortified as they are today, and there were fewer surveillance cameras and other security technologies.

In contrast, modern banks have multiple layers of security, including:

1. Physical security measures, such as vaults, safes, and alarms.
2. Surveillance cameras, both inside and outside the bank.
3. Security personnel, such as armed guards and security officers.
4. Electronic security systems, such as biometric scanners and access control systems.
5. Cash management services, such as armored cars and secure transportation of cash.

Newer tactics may be more appealing to criminals because they are designed to bypass or overcome these modern security measures. For example, cybercrime has become a significant threat to banks, with hackers using sophisticated techniques to steal sensitive information and money. Cybercrime is less risky than traditional bank robbery, as it allows criminals to avoid physical confrontations with law enforcement and to target multiple banks simultaneously.

Additionally, the rise of online banking and digital payments has made it easier for criminals to commit fraud and other financial crimes. For example, phishing scams, identity theft, and account takeover attacks are becoming increasingly common.

In response to these threats, banks are continually investing in new security technologies and strategies to protect their customers and assets. However, as technology evolves, so too do the tactics used by criminals, creating an ongoing cat-and-mouse game between banks and cybercriminals.

Here are some famous examples of American bank robbers:

1. John Dillinger: Known as "Public Enemy No. 1," Dillinger robbed banks across the Midwest during the Great Depression. He was part of a gang that stole over $300,000 in a series of heists.
2. Bonnie and Clyde: The infamous duo, composed of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, robbed banks and gas stations throughout the southern United States during the 1930s. Their crime spree captivated the nation and cemented their place in American folklore.
3. Jesse James: A notorious outlaw, James robbed banks and trains in the late 19th century. He is often romanticized as a folk hero, but his crimes were violent and deadly.
4. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid: This duo, composed of Robert LeRoy Parker and Harry Alonzo Longabaugh, robbed banks and trains in the American West during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Their exploits were immortalized in a 1969 film starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford.
5. Willie Sutton: Known as "The Actor," Sutton robbed banks in the northeastern United States during the 1920s and 1930s. He was known for his clever disguises and ability to blend in with his surroundings.
6. George "Machine Gun" Kelly: A notorious gangster, Kelly robbed banks and kidnapped wealthy individuals during the 1930s. He was known for his violent temperament and his use of a machine gun during heists.
7. Baby Face Nelson: A young and ruthless bank robber, Nelson was part of John Dillinger's gang and participated in several high-profile heists during the 1930s.

These individuals have become infamous in American history, with some even achieving a level of notoriety that has endured long after their crimes were committed.

Of the robbers I mentioned, Willie Sutton's actions were the most recent, as he was active during the 1920s to 1950s. However, if we consider the duration of their crime sprees, Baby Face Nelson's actions were the most recent, as he was active from 1931 until his death in 1934.

As for why they were successful, here are some factors that contributed to their initial success:

1. **Lack of advanced law enforcement technology**: During the 1920s to 1930s, law enforcement agencies lacked the advanced technologies, such as forensic analysis, surveillance cameras, and computerized databases, that are available today. This made it easier for robbers to evade detection and escape.
2. **Poor communication and coordination**: Law enforcement agencies at the time often had poor communication and coordination, which made it difficult for them to share information and track down robbers.
3. **Economic conditions**: The Great Depression created an environment of economic desperation, which led some individuals to turn to crime. The robbers were able to tap into the sentiment of the time, often portraying themselves as folk heroes who were sticking it to the banks and the wealthy elite.
4. **Charisma and cunning**: Many of these robbers, such as John Dillinger and Bonnie and Clyde, were charismatic and cunning individuals who were able to use their charm and intelligence to evade detection and gather loyal followers.
5. **Inside help**: Some robbers, such as Willie Sutton, had inside help from bank employees or other individuals who provided them with valuable information about the banks' security procedures and layouts.

However, it's worth noting that their success was often short-lived, and they were eventually caught and brought to justice. The FBI, in particular, played a significant role in tracking down and apprehending many of these notorious robbers, and their efforts helped to bring an end to the era of high-profile bank robberies in the United States.

The security measures faced and tactics used by the previously mentioned individuals, such as John Dillinger, Bonnie and Clyde, and Willie Sutton, were vastly different from those today. Here are some key differences:

**Security measures then:**

1. **Minimal alarms and surveillance**: Banks had basic alarm systems, but they were often ineffective and easy to disable.
2. **Limited guards and law enforcement**: Banks had few security guards, and law enforcement response times were slow.
3. **No bulletproof glass or barriers**: Bank tellers and customers were easily accessible to robbers.
4. **No electronic tracking**: There were no electronic systems to track stolen money or monitor transactions in real-time.

**Tactics used then:**

1. **Brute force**: Robbers used guns, violence, and intimidation to take control of the bank.
2. **Disguises and deception**: Robbers wore disguises, used fake identities, and created distractions to gain access to the bank.
3. **Insider help**: Some robbers had inside help from bank employees or other individuals who provided them with valuable information.

**Security measures today:**

1. **Advanced alarm systems and surveillance**: Banks have sophisticated alarm systems, motion detectors, and CCTV cameras that can detect and deter robbers.
2. **Enhanced guards and law enforcement**: Banks have more security guards, and law enforcement agencies have faster response times and better coordination.
3. **Bulletproof glass and barriers**: Bank tellers and customers are protected by bulletproof glass and barriers that make it harder for robbers to access them.
4. **Electronic tracking**: Banks use electronic systems to track transactions, monitor accounts, and detect suspicious activity in real-time.

**Newer tactics:**

1. **Cyber attacks**: Hackers can use malware, phishing, and other cyber attacks to steal money and sensitive information from banks.
2. **Identity theft and social engineering**: Criminals can use stolen identities, social engineering tactics, and pretexting to gain access to bank accounts and withdraw money.
3. **ATM skimming and card cloning**: Thieves can use skimming devices and card cloning techniques to steal credit and debit card information.
4. **Online banking and mobile banking attacks**: Hackers can target online banking and mobile banking systems to steal money and sensitive information.

Newer tactics might be more appealing for several reasons:

1. **Lower risk**: Cyber attacks and identity theft can be carried out remotely, reducing the risk of physical harm or detection.
2. **Higher rewards**: Cyber attacks and online banking attacks can potentially yield higher rewards, as they can be used to steal large amounts of money and sensitive information.
3. **Easier to evade detection**: Cyber attacks and identity theft can be difficult to detect, as they often involve sophisticated techniques and anonymity tools.
4. **Greater anonymity**: Cyber attacks and online banking attacks can be carried out from anywhere in the world, making it harder for law enforcement to track down the perpetrators.

Overall, the security measures and tactics used by robbers have evolved significantly over time, with a shift towards more sophisticated and technologically driven methods.
