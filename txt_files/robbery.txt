 I can provide some examples of infamous American bank robbers. Here are a few:

1. John Dillinger: Known as "Public Enemy No. 1" during the Great Depression, Dillinger robbed banks and committed other crimes from 1933 to 1934.

2. Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow: This notorious duo, along with their gang, committed numerous robberies, murders, and other crimes in the 1930s.

3. Jesse James: A notorious outlaw and gang leader in the post-Civil War era, James and his brother, Frank James, were known for their bank and train robberies.

4. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid: This pair, along with their Wild Bunch gang, were known for their train and bank robberies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

5. Willie Sutton: Known for his quote, "Why do I rob banks? Because that's where the money is," Sutton was a prolific bank robber in the mid-20th century.

6. Alvin Karpis: Known as the "Scourge of the Plains," Karpis was a member of the Ma Barker gang and was one of the longest-serving prisoners in the federal prison system.

7. Charles Arthur "Pretty Boy" Floyd: A notorious bank robber and gangster during the Great Depression, Floyd was known for his good looks and charisma.

8. Baby Face Nelson: A violent bank robber and gangster during the 1930s, Nelson was known for his quick temper and willingness to use violence.

9. George "Machine Gun" Kelly: A notorious gangster during the 1930s, Kelly was known for his violent crimes, including bank robberies and kidnappings.

10. Donald "D.B." Cooper: In 1971, Cooper hijacked a commercial airplane and demanded a ransom of $200,000. He parachuted from the plane with the money and was never seen again. His case remains unsolved.

 The actions of the robber known as D.B. Cooper were the most recent, as they occurred in 1971. D.B. Cooper's success can be attributed to several factors:

1. Planning and preparation: Cooper carefully planned his hijacking, including researching the flight route, learning the airline's security procedures, and obtaining a fake identification.

2. Timing: Cooper chose to hijack a flight during a time when airline security was relatively lax, and he took advantage of the fact that the plane was flying over remote terrain, making it difficult for authorities to track him.

3. Execution: Cooper was able to successfully hijack the plane, demand a ransom, and parachute from the plane with the money. He was never seen again, and the case remains unsolved.

It's important to note that Cooper's actions were illegal and highly dangerous, and his methods should not be emulated.

 The security measures faced by the bank robbers mentioned earlier, such as John Dillinger, Bonnie and Clyde, Jesse James, Butch Cassidy, and Alvin Karpis, were significantly different from the security measures in place today. At that time, banks were often less secure, with fewer cameras, alarms, and security personnel.

In contrast, modern banks have implemented numerous security measures to deter and prevent robberies, including:

1. Video surveillance: Banks are equipped with multiple cameras that monitor every area of the bank, both inside and outside.

2. Alarms: Banks have alarms on doors and vaults that are triggered if they are forced open.

3. Security personnel: Banks employ security guards to monitor the premises and respond to any suspicious activity.

4. Cash handling procedures: Banks have strict procedures for handling cash, including counting and transporting it, to minimize the risk of theft.

5. Technology: Banks use advanced technology, such as biometric scanners and encryption, to secure transactions and protect customer information.

Newer tactics may be more appealing to criminals because they are designed to bypass or exploit these security measures. For example, cybercrime, such as hacking bank accounts or stealing sensitive information, has become a growing concern for banks and their customers. Cybercriminals can operate from anywhere in the world, making it difficult for law enforcement to track them down. Additionally, cybercrime can be more lucrative than traditional bank robbery, as it allows criminals to steal large amounts of money without putting themselves at risk of physical harm.

Of the robbers I mentioned, Amil Dinsio's actions were the most recent, spanning from the 1970s to the 1980s. Dinsio, also known as the "King of Bank Robbers," was a notorious bank robber who robbed over 50 banks during his career.

Amil Dinsio's success can be attributed to several factors:

1. **Sophisticated planning**: Dinsio was known for his meticulous planning and research. He would often case a bank for weeks or even months before attempting a robbery, studying the bank's security measures, employee routines, and customer traffic.
2. **Disguises and deception**: Dinsio was a master of disguise and used various costumes, wigs, and fake mustaches to alter his appearance. He would also use fake IDs and pose as a delivery person, maintenance worker, or other authorized individual to gain access to the bank.
3. **Inside help**: In some cases, Dinsio had inside help from bank employees or former employees who would provide him with information about the bank's security systems and procedures.
4. **Non-violent approach**: Dinsio was known for his non-violent approach to bank robbery. He would often use a note or a persuasive conversation to convince bank employees to hand over cash, rather than resorting to violence or intimidation.
5. **Staying one step ahead of the law**: Dinsio was able to evade law enforcement for many years by constantly changing his appearance, using fake IDs, and moving frequently. He also had a network of associates and informants who would provide him with information about potential law enforcement activity.

Dinsio's success was ultimately ended in 1991, when he was arrested and convicted of bank robbery. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison and served 15 years before being released in 2006. Despite his eventual capture, Amil Dinsio remains one of the most notorious and successful bank robbers in American history.

The security measures faced by Amil Dinsio and other bank robbers in the 1970s and 1980s were relatively primitive compared to those today. Here are some key differences:

**Older security measures:**

1. **Limited surveillance**: Banks had fewer security cameras, and those that existed were often of poor quality.
2. **No digital alarms**: Banks relied on manual alarms, such as panic buttons, which could be easily disabled.
3. **Less advanced locks**: Vaults and doors had simpler locking mechanisms that could be picked or compromised with relative ease.
4. **No biometric authentication**: Bank employees and customers were not required to use biometric authentication, such as fingerprints or facial recognition.
5. **Less sophisticated money tracking**: Banks did not have advanced systems for tracking and tracing cash, making it harder to recover stolen funds.

**Modern security measures:**

1. **Advanced surveillance**: Banks are now equipped with high-quality security cameras, including IP cameras, CCTV, and facial recognition software.
2. **Digital alarms and sensors**: Banks use advanced alarm systems, motion detectors, and pressure pads to detect and prevent intrusions.
3. **Secure locks and barriers**: Vaults and doors are equipped with advanced locking mechanisms, such as combination locks, biometric authentication, and reinforced materials.
4. **Biometric authentication**: Many banks require employees and customers to use biometric authentication, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, to access secure areas or conduct transactions.
5. **Advanced money tracking**: Banks use advanced systems, such as RFID and GPS tracking, to monitor and recover stolen cash.

**Newer tactics:**

Given the increased security measures, bank robbers have adapted and developed new tactics, such as:

1. **Cyber attacks**: Hackers target bank computer systems to steal funds or sensitive information.
2. **Phishing and social engineering**: Scammers use psychological manipulation to trick bank employees or customers into revealing sensitive information or transferring funds.
3. **ATM skimming and card trapping**: Thieves use ATMs to steal card information and PINs, or trap cards to withdraw cash.
4. **Inside jobs**: Bank employees or former employees are coerced or bribed to assist in robberies or provide sensitive information.
5. **Tunneling and digging**: Thieves dig tunnels or use other methods to bypass security measures and access bank vaults.

**Why newer tactics might be more appealing:**

Newer tactics might be more appealing to modern bank robbers for several reasons:

1. **Lower risk**: Cyber attacks and social engineering tactics can be carried out remotely, reducing the risk of physical detection and capture.
2. **Higher rewards**: Modern bank robbers can potentially steal larger amounts of money or sensitive information, which can be sold on the black market.
3. **Easier to carry out**: Newer tactics often require less planning and expertise than traditional bank robberies, making them more accessible to a wider range of individuals.
4. **Increased anonymity**: Modern bank robbers can use encryption, VPNs, and other tools to remain anonymous and avoid detection.

Overall, the evolution of security measures has led to a cat-and-mouse game between banks and bank robbers, with each side adapting and innovating to stay ahead of the other.
