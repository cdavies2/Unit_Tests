John Dillinger was a notorious American bank robber and gangster during the Great Depression. He was born on June 22, 1903, in Indianapolis, Indiana, and rose to prominence in the early 1930s for his brazen bank heists and escapes from prison.

Dillinger's life of crime began in the 1920s, but it wasn't until 1933 that he gained national attention for his involvement in a string of bank robberies across the Midwest. He was known for his charisma, intelligence, and ruthlessness, which earned him the nickname "Public Enemy Number One" from the FBI.

Dillinger's gang, which included other infamous outlaws such as Homer Van Meter, Eddie Green, and Tommy Carroll, robbed banks in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin, netting hundreds of thousands of dollars. They also killed several police officers and civilians during their crimes.

In 1934, Dillinger was arrested and imprisoned in Indiana, but he escaped from jail using a wooden gun. He then went on to rob more banks and engage in a series of shootouts with law enforcement.

On July 22, 1934, Dillinger was fatally shot by FBI agents outside the Biograph Theater in Chicago, Illinois, where he had been watching a movie with his girlfriend, Anna Sage. The FBI had been tipped off to his location by Sage, who had become an informant for the agency.

Dillinger's death marked the end of his notorious crime spree, but his legend has endured in American popular culture. He has been the subject of numerous books, films, and TV shows, including the 2009 movie "Public Enemies," in which he was portrayed by Johnny Depp.

John Dillinger and his gang used a variety of tactics to succeed in their bank robberies and evade law enforcement. Some of these tactics included:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Dillinger and his gang would often case a bank before robbing it, gathering information about the bank's layout, security measures, and routines.
2. **Intimidation**: Dillinger and his gang would use intimidation to control the situation during a robbery. They would often wield machine guns and threaten to harm bank employees and customers if they did not comply.
3. **Speed and surprise**: Dillinger's gang would often hit a bank quickly, using the element of surprise to their advantage. They would burst into the bank, yell for everyone to get down, and quickly gather as much cash as possible.
4. **Disguises**: Dillinger and his gang would often use disguises, such as wigs, hats, and sunglasses, to avoid being recognized during a robbery.
5. **Stolen cars**: The gang would often use stolen cars to get to and from a robbery, making it harder for law enforcement to track them.
6. **Inside help**: In some cases, Dillinger's gang would have inside help from a bank employee or someone with knowledge of the bank's security measures.
7. **Split-second getaways**: Dillinger's gang would often have a getaway car waiting nearby, and would make a quick escape after a robbery.
8. **Use of safe houses**: Dillinger and his gang would often use safe houses, where they could lay low and avoid detection by law enforcement.
9. **Code of silence**: Dillinger's gang had a code of silence, where they would not talk to law enforcement or reveal information about their activities, even if they were caught.
10. **Use of technology**: Dillinger's gang was one of the first to use technology, such as machine guns and bulletproof vests, to aid them in their crimes.

It's worth noting that while these tactics were effective for a time, they ultimately contributed to Dillinger's downfall. The FBI and other law enforcement agencies were able to use similar tactics, such as gathering intelligence and using informants, to track down and catch Dillinger and his gang.

Additionally, Dillinger's arrogance and tendency to taunt law enforcement, as well as his increasing notoriety, made him a high-priority target for the FBI, which eventually led to his demise.

	* Informant networks: Law enforcement agencies have developed extensive informant networks, making it harder for criminals to operate undetected.
	* Social media monitoring: Social media platforms can provide valuable information about suspects and their activities.
	* Data mining: Advanced data analysis techniques can help identify patterns and connections between individuals and organizations.
3. **Enhanced security measures**: Banks and other financial institutions have implemented robust security measures, including:
	* Alarm systems: Modern alarm systems can quickly alert law enforcement in the event of a robbery.
	* Secure doors and barriers: Many banks have secure doors and barriers that can slow down or prevent robbers from escaping.
	* Cash handling procedures: Banks have implemented procedures to limit the amount of cash available during business hours, making it harder for robbers to get away with large amounts of money.
4. **Increased international cooperation**: Law enforcement agencies around the world cooperate and share information more effectively than in the past, making it harder for criminals to operate across borders.
5. **Changes in societal attitudes**: The public's perception of crime has changed, and there is a greater willingness to cooperate with law enforcement and report suspicious activity.
6. **More effective policing strategies**: Law enforcement agencies have developed more effective strategies for preventing and investigating crimes, including:
	* Community policing: Building relationships with local communities helps to gather intelligence and prevent crimes.
	* Intelligence-led policing: Focusing on high-risk individuals and organizations, rather than just responding to crimes, can help prevent robberies.
7. **Regulatory environment**: The regulatory environment has changed, with stricter laws and regulations in place to prevent money laundering and other financial crimes.

Given these factors, it's unlikely that John Dillinger would have been able to achieve the same level of success today. He would have faced a more sophisticated and technologically advanced law enforcement apparatus, as well as more robust security measures and a more vigilant public.
