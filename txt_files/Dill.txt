 It is difficult to say whether John Dillinger would have been as successful today as he was during the Great Depression. There are several factors that could have contributed to his success during that time that may not be present today:

1. Lack of technology: During the Great Depression, law enforcement agencies did not have the same level of technology that they have today. This made it more difficult for them to track and apprehend criminals like Dillinger.
2. Public sentiment: During the Great Depression, there was a high level of public sympathy for criminals like Dillinger, who were seen as Robin Hood-like figures who were taking from the rich and giving to the poor. This public sentiment may not be present today, and law enforcement agencies may have more public support in their efforts to apprehend criminals.
3. Law enforcement tactics: Law enforcement agencies today have more resources and tactics at their disposal than they did during the Great Depression. For example, they have access to advanced surveillance technology, forensic analysis, and databases of criminal records.
4. Public awareness: Today, the public is more aware of the dangers of crime and the consequences of criminal activity. This may make it more difficult for criminals like Dillinger to operate without being detected.
5. Increased cooperation between law enforcement agencies: Today, law enforcement agencies work together more closely than they did during the Great Depression. This makes it more difficult for criminals to evade capture by moving from one jurisdiction to another.

Overall, it is difficult to say whether Dillinger would have been as successful today as he was during the Great Depression. While there are certainly factors that could have made it more difficult for him to operate, it is also possible that he would have adapted to the changes and found new ways to evade capture.

John Dillinger was a notorious American gangster and bank robber during the Great Depression. He was born on June 22, 1903, in Indianapolis, Indiana, and rose to prominence in the early 1930s for his involvement in a string of bank robberies and other crimes.

Dillinger's life of crime began in the 1920s, when he was involved in petty theft and burglary. However, it wasn't until the early 1930s that he gained notoriety for his brazen bank robberies, which were often carried out with the help of his gang, known as the "Dillinger Gang" or the "Terror Gang."

Dillinger's gang, which included notorious criminals like Homer Van Meter, Eddie Green, and Tommy Carroll, robbed banks across the Midwest, often using violent tactics to intimidate bank employees and customers. They also kidnapped police officers and used them as hostages to facilitate their escapes.

Dillinger's exploits captivated the American public, and he was often portrayed in the media as a folk hero or a modern-day Robin Hood. However, his crimes were brutal and devastating to the communities he targeted.

In 1934, Dillinger was named the FBI's "Public Enemy Number One," and a nationwide manhunt was launched to capture him. On July 22, 1934, Dillinger was shot and killed by FBI agents outside the Biograph Theater in Chicago, Illinois, where he had gone to see a movie. The agents, led by Melvin Purvis, had been tipped off about Dillinger's whereabouts and ambushed him as he left the theater.

Dillinger's death marked the end of his reign of terror, but his legend has endured as a symbol of the lawlessness and desperation of the Great Depression era. His story has been immortalized in numerous books, films, and popular culture references, cementing his place as one of the most infamous American gangsters of all time.

John Dillinger and his gang used a variety of tactics to succeed in their bank robberies and other crimes. Some of the notable tactics they employed include:

1. **Intelligence gathering**: Dillinger and his gang would often gather information about their target banks, including the layout, security measures, and the routines of the bank employees. They would use this information to plan their heists and minimize the risk of detection.
2. **Disguises**: Dillinger and his gang members would often wear disguises, such as wigs, hats, and sunglasses, to avoid being recognized by witnesses or law enforcement.
3. **Violence and intimidation**: The gang would use violence and intimidation to subdue bank employees and customers. They would often wave guns, yell, and use physical force to get what they wanted.
4. **Hostage-taking**: Dillinger and his gang would sometimes take hostages, including bank employees, police officers, or other individuals, to use as leverage to facilitate their escape.
5. **Getaway cars**: The gang would often use stolen cars or rental cars to make their getaways, and would switch cars frequently to avoid detection.
6. **Network of informants**: Dillinger had a network of informants and associates who would provide him with information about potential targets, as well as help him to evade law enforcement.
7. **Use of safe houses**: The gang would use safe houses, often rented or borrowed from associates, to hide out and plan their next heists.
8. **Mobility**: Dillinger and his gang were highly mobile, traveling from town to town and state to state to carry out their robberies. This made it difficult for law enforcement to track them down.
9. **Use of inside help**: In some cases, Dillinger and his gang had inside help from bank employees or other individuals who would provide them with information or assistance in carrying out the robbery.
10. ** Cunning and adaptability**: Dillinger was known for his cunning and adaptability, and was able to think on his feet and adjust his plans as necessary to stay one step ahead of law enforcement.

Some of the specific tactics Dillinger used in his bank robberies included:

* Using a "stickup" method, where he would enter the bank, wave a gun, and demand that everyone get down on the floor.
* Using a "tunnel" method, where he would enter the bank through a side door or a tunnel, and then surprise the bank employees and customers.
* Using a "crowbar" method, where he would use a crowbar to pry open the bank's vault or doors.
* Using a "fake bomb" method, where he would claim to have a bomb and threaten to detonate it if his demands were not met.

It's worth noting that while Dillinger's tactics were effective in the short term, they ultimately led to his downfall. The FBI and other law enforcement agencies were able to use his tactics against him, and his eventual capture and killing were the result of a combination of good intelligence, careful planning, and luck.
