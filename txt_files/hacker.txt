 I am happy to share some major hacking incidents from the past 20 years:

1. Yahoo Data Breach (2013-2014): Hackers stole personal data, including email addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth, of over 3 billion Yahoo users.

2. Equifax Data Breach (2017): Hackers gained access to the personal information of approximately 147 million people, including social security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and driver's license numbers.

3. Target Data Breach (2013): Hackers stole credit and debit card information of around 40 million customers during the holiday shopping season.

4. Sony Pictures Entertainment Hack (2014): North Korean hackers infiltrated Sony Pictures Entertainment's computer system, leaking sensitive emails and confidential data.

5. JPMorgan Chase Data Breach (2014): Hackers stole personal data, including names, addresses, and phone numbers, of around 83 million households and 7 million small businesses.

6. Home Depot Data Breach (2014): Hackers stole credit and debit card information of around 56 million customers.

7. Anthem Data Breach (2015): Hackers stole personal data, including social security numbers, addresses, and employment information, of around 78.8 million people.

8. Marriott International Data Breach (2018): Hackers gained access to the personal data of around 500 million guests, including passport numbers, mailing addresses, and phone numbers.

9. Capital One Data Breach (2019): Hacker obtained personal data, including credit scores, addresses, and phone numbers, of around 100 million people.

10. Twitter Hack (2020): Hackers gained access to the accounts of high-profile individuals, including Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Barack Obama, to scam their followers out of cryptocurrency.
mistral : 
 The most recent incident mentioned is the Twitter Hack that occurred in 2020.
mistral : 
 The individuals involved in the Twitter hack used social engineering tactics to gain access to the accounts of high-profile individuals. They contacted Twitter's support team and claimed to be the account holders, providing enough information to convince the support team to grant them access to the accounts. Once they had access, they posted tweets offering to double any Bitcoin sent to a specific wallet, which resulted in the scamming of their followers out of cryptocurrency.
mistral : 
 If the incident occurred today, the tactics might have evolved to take advantage of new technologies and platforms. For example, the hackers might have used more sophisticated phishing techniques to gain access to the accounts, such as using deepfake technology to impersonate the account holders in emails or messages. They might also have used more advanced social engineering tactics to gather more personal information about the account holders and their followers, making their scam more convincing. Additionally, they might have targeted more platforms beyond Twitter, such as other social media platforms, email, or even messaging apps.

The most recent incident I mentioned was the **Marriott International Breach (2018)**, which occurred in 2018, and the breach was discovered and disclosed in November 2018.
llama3 : 
The Marriott International Breach (2018) was a complex incident, and the tactics used by the individuals involved are still being investigated. However, according to reports and statements from Marriott and security experts, here are some of the tactics that are believed to have been used:

1. **Unauthorized access to the Starwood guest reservation database**: The attackers gained access to the Starwood guest reservation database, which contained sensitive information, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, passport numbers, and credit card numbers.
2. **Exploitation of a vulnerability**: The attackers are believed to have exploited a vulnerability in the Starwood database to gain initial access. The exact nature of the vulnerability is not publicly known.
3. **Use of phishing and social engineering**: It is believed that the attackers used phishing and social engineering tactics to trick Starwood employees into revealing their login credentials, which were then used to gain access to the database.
4. **Encrypted data extraction**: The attackers were able to extract encrypted data from the database, including credit card numbers and passport numbers. It is believed that they used specialized software to decrypt the data.
5. **Data exfiltration**: The attackers were able to transfer the stolen data out of the Starwood network, possibly using encrypted channels or other evasion techniques.
6. **Use of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) tactics**: The attackers are believed to have used APT tactics, including custom-made malware and evasion techniques, to avoid detection and maintain access to the Starwood network for an extended period.

It's worth noting that the investigation into the Marriott breach is ongoing, and the exact tactics used by the attackers may never be fully known. However, it is clear that the breach was a sophisticated and targeted attack that exploited vulnerabilities in the Starwood system and used advanced tactics to evade detection.

If the Marriott International Breach were to occur today, the tactics used by the attackers might be different in several ways, reflecting the evolution of threat actor techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) and the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks. Here are some possible differences:

1. **More targeted and tailored phishing campaigns**: Attackers might use more advanced phishing tactics, such as spear phishing, whaling, or business email compromise (BEC) attacks, which are highly targeted and tailored to specific individuals or groups.
2. **Increased use of social engineering**: Social engineering tactics, such as pretexting, baiting, or quid pro quo, might be used to trick employees into revealing sensitive information or gaining access to the network.
3. **Exploitation of cloud-based vulnerabilities**: As more organizations move to the cloud, attackers might focus on exploiting vulnerabilities in cloud-based infrastructure, such as cloud storage, cloud-based databases, or cloud-based identity and access management (IAM) systems.
4. **Use of Advanced Threats**: Attackers might employ more advanced threats, such as:
	* **Fileless malware**: Malware that resides in memory only and does not write any files to disk, making it harder to detect.
	* **Living off the Land (LOTL)**: Attackers might use existing system tools and software to carry out their attacks, rather than introducing new malware.
	* **Zero-day exploits**: Attackers might use previously unknown vulnerabilities (zero-days) to gain access to systems or data.
5. **Increased focus on credential-based attacks**: Attackers might focus on stealing or cracking credentials, such as passwords or encryption keys, to gain access to sensitive data or systems.
6. **More emphasis on evasion and anti-forensics**: Attackers might use techniques to evade detection, such as:
	* **Code obfuscation**: Making malware code difficult to understand or analyze.
	* **Anti-forensics**: Deleting or altering logs, modifying system files, or using other techniques to conceal their activities.
7. **Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)**: Attackers might leverage AI and ML to:
	* **Improve phishing campaigns**: Using AI to generate more convincing and targeted phishing emails.
	* **Analyze and adapt**: Using ML to analyze the target's defenses and adapt their tactics accordingly.
8. **More focus on supply chain attacks**: Attackers might target third-party vendors or suppliers to gain access to the target organization's network or data.
9. **Increased use of Insider threats**: Attackers might recruit or coerce insiders, such as employees or contractors, to assist in the attack or provide sensitive information.
10. **More emphasis on data encryption and ransomware**: Attackers might focus on encrypting sensitive data and demanding ransom, rather than just stealing the data.

These are just a few possible differences in tactics that might be used if the Marriott International Breach were to occur today. The threat landscape is constantly evolving, and attackers are continually adapting and improving their techniques to evade detection and achieve their goals.
