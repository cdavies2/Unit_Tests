 I am happy to share some major hacking incidents from the past 20 years:

1. Yahoo Data Breaches (2013-2014): Hackers stole personal data, including email addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth, of over 3 billion Yahoo users.

2. Equifax Data Breach (2017): Hackers gained access to the personal information of approximately 147 million people, including social security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and driver's license numbers.

3. Target Data Breach (2013): Hackers stole credit and debit card information of around 40 million customers during the holiday shopping season.

4. Sony Pictures Hack (2014): North Korean hackers infiltrated Sony Pictures Entertainment, leaking sensitive emails, movies, and personal data.

5. JPMorgan Chase Data Breach (2014): Hackers stole personal data, including names, addresses, and phone numbers, of around 83 million households and 7 million small businesses.

6. Home Depot Data Breach (2014): Hackers stole credit and debit card information of around 56 million customers.

7. Anthem Data Breach (2015): Hackers stole personal data, including social security numbers, addresses, and employment information, of around 78.8 million people.

8. Marriott International Data Breach (2018): Hackers gained access to the personal data of around 500 million guests, including passport numbers, mailing addresses, and phone numbers.

9. Capital One Data Breach (2019): Hacker gained access to personal data, including credit scores, addresses, and phone numbers, of around 100 million people.

 The most recent incident mentioned is the Twitter Hack that occurred in 2020.
mistral : 
 The individuals involved in the Twitter hack used social engineering tactics to gain access to the accounts of high-profile users. They tricked Twitter employees into providing them with login credentials and other sensitive information. Once they had access to the accounts, they posted tweets offering to double Bitcoin payments to anyone who sent a certain amount to a specific Bitcoin wallet. The tweets were sent from the accounts of high-profile individuals, which helped to make the scam appear more legitimate. The hackers were able to make off with a significant amount of Bitcoin before Twitter was able to secure the accounts and stop the scam.
mistral : 
 If the same incident occurred today, the tactics might be similar, but there are a few ways they could potentially be different.

1. Two-Factor Authentication: Many companies, including Twitter, have implemented two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an extra layer of security to accounts. This would make it more difficult for hackers to gain access to accounts by requiring users to verify their identity through a second method, such as a text message or an authentication app.

2. Employee Training: Companies have become more aware of the importance of employee training in preventing cyber attacks. Employees are now trained to be more vigilant and to be aware of phishing attempts and other social engineering tactics.

3. Security Measures: Companies have also implemented additional security measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption, to protect against cyber attacks.

4. Rapid Response: Companies have also become more adept at responding quickly to cyber attacks, which can help to limit the damage caused by the attack.

5. Cryptocurrency Regulations: Cryptocurrency regulations have become more stringent, making it more difficult for hackers to launder the funds they steal.

6. Public Awareness: The public is also more aware of the risks of cyber attacks and is more likely to be cautious when interacting with online scams.

Overall, while the tactics used in the Twitter hack could still be effective, the increased security measures and public awareness make it more difficult for hackers to carry out similar attacks today.

The most recent incident I mentioned was the **Marriott International Data Breach (2014-2018)**, which was discovered in 2018. However, it's worth noting that the breach itself occurred over a period of four years, from 2014 to 2018.

If you're looking for the most recent incident in terms of when it was discovered or reported, I would say it's the Marriott International Data Breach, which was announced by Marriott on November 30, 2018.

However, if you'd like to know about more recent incidents that have occurred after 2018, I can provide you with some examples:

* **SolarWinds Hack (2020)**: A major cyberattack was discovered in December 2020, which affected several US government agencies and private companies.
* **Microsoft Exchange Server Hack (2021)**: A vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server was exploited by hackers in March 2021, affecting thousands of organizations worldwide.
* **Colonial Pipeline Ransomware Attack (2021)**: A ransomware attack was launched against Colonial Pipeline, a major US oil pipeline operator, in May 2021, causing widespread fuel shortages.

Let me know if you'd like more information on these or other recent incidents!

The Marriott International Data Breach (2014-2018) was a complex incident, and the tactics used by the individuals involved are not entirely clear. However, based on the investigation and publicly available information, here are some tactics that are believed to have been used:

1. **Phishing**: The attackers may have used phishing emails to gain initial access to Marriott's network. Phishing emails are designed to trick employees into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials.
2. **Credential stuffing**: The attackers may have used credential stuffing techniques to gain access to Marriott's systems. Credential stuffing involves using automated tools to try millions of username and password combinations, often obtained from previous data breaches.
3. **Exploiting vulnerabilities**: The attackers may have exploited vulnerabilities in Marriott's systems, such as unpatched software or misconfigured servers, to gain access to sensitive data.
4. **Malware**: The attackers may have used malware, such as remote access trojans (RATs) or keyloggers, to gain control of Marriott's systems and steal sensitive data.
5. **Encryption**: The attackers may have used encryption to hide their malware and evade detection by Marriott's security systems.
6. **Living off the land (LOTL)**: The attackers may have used LOTL tactics, which involve using existing system tools and software to carry out their attack, rather than introducing new malware. This makes it harder to detect their activities.
7. **Data exfiltration**: The attackers used Marriott's own systems to exfiltrate sensitive data, including guest information, to their own servers.

It's worth noting that the investigation into the Marriott breach was conducted by Marriott and various law enforcement agencies, and the exact tactics used by the attackers may not be publicly known.

The attackers were believed to be a Chinese intelligence group, known as the "APT10" or "Stone Panda" group, which has been linked to several other high-profile data breaches. The group is known for its sophisticated tactics and techniques, and is believed to have been working on behalf of the Chinese government.

In 2020, the US Department of Justice indicted two Chinese nationals, Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong, for their alleged roles in the Marriott breach, as well as several other data breaches. The indictment alleged that the two men worked for the Chinese Ministry of State Security and used their hacking skills to steal sensitive data from companies around the world.

If the Marriott International Data Breach were to occur today, the tactics used by the attackers might be different in several ways. Here are some possible differences:

1. **More advanced phishing techniques**: Phishing emails and messages have become increasingly sophisticated, using AI-generated content, personalized spear phishing, and other tactics to evade detection.
2. **Increased use of cloud-based attacks**: Cloud services have become more prevalent, and attackers might focus on exploiting vulnerabilities in cloud infrastructure, such as AWS or Azure, to gain access to sensitive data.
3. **More emphasis on identity-based attacks**: With the rise of identity and access management (IAM) systems, attackers might focus on exploiting weaknesses in these systems to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
4. **Use of deepfakes and AI-generated content**: Attackers might use deepfakes, AI-generated videos, or audio recordings to trick employees into revealing sensitive information or to create convincing phishing emails.
5. **Exploitation of IoT devices**: With the growing number of IoT devices in hotels and other industries, attackers might target these devices as an entry point for their attacks.
6. **More sophisticated malware and ransomware**: Malware and ransomware have become increasingly advanced, with features like evasion techniques, anti-analysis tactics, and AI-powered decision-making.
7. **Increased use of living-off-the-land (LOTL) tactics**: Attackers might focus more on using existing system tools and software to carry out their attacks, making it harder to detect their activities.
8. **Use of insider threats**: Attackers might try to recruit or compromise insider threats, such as employees or contractors, to gain access to sensitive data or systems.
9. **More focus on data manipulation**: In addition to data exfiltration, attackers might focus on manipulating data to create chaos, disrupt operations, or extort money from the victim organization.
10. **Use of advanced persistence threats (APTs)**: APTs are sophisticated, targeted attacks that use multiple tactics and techniques to achieve their goals. Attackers might use APTs to maintain long-term access to Marriott's systems and data.

To defend against these tactics, organizations like Marriott might employ more advanced security measures, such as:

1. **Implementing AI-powered security tools**: AI-powered tools can help detect and respond to threats in real-time, reducing the risk of successful attacks.
2. **Conducting regular security audits and penetration testing**: Regular security audits and penetration testing can help identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses before they can be exploited by attackers.
3. **Implementing a zero-trust security model**: A zero-trust security model assumes that all users and devices are untrusted, and verifies their identity and permissions before granting access to sensitive data or systems.
4. **Providing regular security awareness training**: Security awareness training can help employees recognize and report suspicious activity, reducing the risk of successful phishing and social engineering attacks.
5. **Implementing incident response plans**: Incident response plans can help organizations respond quickly and effectively to security incidents, reducing the impact of an attack.

By staying up-to-date with the latest security threats and tactics, organizations like Marriott can improve their defenses and reduce the risk of successful attacks.
