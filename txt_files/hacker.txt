2. Equifax Data Breach (2017): Hackers gained access to the personal information of approximately 147 million people, including social security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and driver's license numbers.

3. Target Data Breach (2013): Hackers stole credit and debit card information of around 40 million customers during the holiday shopping season.

4. Sony Pictures Entertainment Hack (2014): North Korean hackers infiltrated Sony Pictures Entertainment's computer network, leaking sensitive emails and confidential data.

5. JPMorgan Chase Data Breach (2014): Hackers stole personal data, including names, addresses, and phone numbers, of around 83 million households and 7 million small businesses.

6. Home Depot Data Breach (2014): Hackers stole credit and debit card information of around 56 million customers.

 The most recent incident mentioned is the Twitter Hack that occurred in 2020.
mistral : 
 The individuals involved in the Twitter hack used social engineering tactics to gain access to the accounts of high-profile individuals. They contacted Twitter's support team and claimed to be the account holders, providing enough information to convince the support team to grant them access to the accounts. Once they had access, they tweeted out scam messages asking their followers to send them Bitcoin in exchange for a larger amount of Bitcoin. The scam was successful in stealing a significant amount of cryptocurrency from unsuspecting followers.
mistral : 
 If the incident occurred today, the tactics might have evolved to take advantage of new technologies and platforms. For example, the hackers might have used more sophisticated phishing techniques to gain access to the accounts, such as using deepfake audio or video to impersonate the account holders more convincingly. They might also have targeted more platforms beyond Twitter, such as Instagram, Facebook, or other social media platforms, to reach a wider audience. Additionally, they might have used more advanced methods to launder the stolen cryptocurrency, making it harder to trace and recover.

The most recent incident mentioned was the **Marriott International Data Breach (2018)**, which occurred in 2018. However, it's worth noting that the breach was discovered and reported in November 2018, but the actual breach is believed to have occurred between 2014 and 2018.

If you're looking for more recent incidents, I can provide information on other notable hacking incidents that have occurred since 2018. Just let me know!

The Marriott International Data Breach (2018) was a complex incident, and the tactics used by the individuals involved are still being investigated and analyzed. However, based on publicly available information, here are some of the tactics that are believed to have been used:

1. **Unauthorized access**: The attackers gained unauthorized access to Marriott's Starwood guest reservation database, which was acquired by Marriott in 2016.
2. **Credential stuffing**: The attackers used a technique called credential stuffing, where they used a large number of stolen username and password combinations to attempt to log in to Marriott's system.
3. **Phishing**: The attackers may have used phishing emails or other social engineering tactics to trick Marriott employees into revealing their login credentials or providing other sensitive information.
4. **Exploitation of vulnerabilities**: The attackers may have exploited vulnerabilities in Marriott's system, such as unpatched software or misconfigured databases, to gain access to sensitive data.
5. **Data encryption**: The attackers encrypted the stolen data, making it difficult for Marriott to detect and respond to the breach.
6. **Covering their tracks**: The attackers attempted to cover their tracks by deleting logs and other evidence of their activity, making it challenging for Marriott to investigate the breach.
7. **Using compromised credentials**: The attackers used compromised credentials, such as login credentials, to access the Starwood database and steal sensitive information.

It's worth noting that the investigation into the Marriott breach is ongoing, and the exact tactics used by the attackers may not be fully known. However, it's clear that the attackers used a combination of social engineering, exploiting vulnerabilities, and other advanced tactics to carry out the breach.

The attackers behind the Marriott breach are believed to be linked to the Chinese government, and the incident is seen as a significant example of a state-sponsored cyberattack.

If the Marriott International Data Breach were to occur today, the tactics used by the attackers might be different due to the evolution of cyber threats, advances in security measures, and changes in the cyber landscape. Here are some possible ways the tactics might differ:

1. **More sophisticated phishing attacks**: Phishing attacks have become more sophisticated, using AI-generated emails, fake websites, and social engineering tactics to trick victims into revealing sensitive information.
2. **Increased use of Zero-Day Exploits**: Attackers might use zero-day exploits, which are previously unknown vulnerabilities in software or hardware, to gain unauthorized access to systems.
3. **Greater emphasis on Supply Chain Attacks**: Attackers might focus on targeting Marriott's supply chain, such as third-party vendors or contractors, to gain access to sensitive information.
4. **Use of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**: APTs involve a prolonged and targeted attack on a specific organization, using customized malware and tactics to evade detection.
5. **Leveraging Cloud Services**: Attackers might use cloud services, such as cloud storage or cloud-based applications, to host and distribute malware, or to exfiltrate data.
6. **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)**: Attackers might use AI and ML to analyze and exploit vulnerabilities, or to create more sophisticated phishing attacks.
7. **Increased focus on IoT devices**: With the growing number of IoT devices, attackers might target these devices to gain access to Marriott's network or to create a botnet.
8. **Use of Fileless Malware**: Fileless malware resides in memory only and doesn't write any files to disk, making it harder to detect and remove.
9. **Living Off The Land (LOTL) tactics**: Attackers might use existing system tools and applications to carry out their attacks, rather than introducing new malware, making it harder to detect and respond to the breach.
10. **More emphasis on Credential Abuse**: Attackers might focus on stealing and abusing credentials, such as usernames and passwords, to gain access to systems and data.

In terms of defense, Marriott might have implemented additional security measures, such as:

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Requiring employees and customers to use MFA to access systems and data.
2. **Advanced Threat Detection**: Implementing advanced threat detection tools, such as AI-powered security software, to identify and respond to potential threats.
3. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing**: Conducting regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
4. **Employee Education and Awareness**: Educating employees on cybersecurity best practices and the importance of being vigilant against phishing and social engineering attacks.
5. **Incident Response Planning**: Having an incident response plan in place, including procedures for responding to and containing a breach.

These are just a few examples of how the tactics used in the Marriott breach might differ if it were to occur today. The cyber landscape is constantly evolving, and it's essential for organizations to stay ahead of the threats and adapt their security measures accordingly.
