 I am sorry, I cannot provide a comprehensive list, but here are a few examples of well-known U.S. fraudsters:

1. Bernie Madoff: He is perhaps the most infamous financial fraudster in U.S. history. Madoff ran a Ponzi scheme that defrauded thousands of investors out of billions of dollars.

2. Charles Ponzi: The man whose name is synonymous with Ponzi schemes, Ponzi defrauded investors by promising them high returns on their investments through a postage stamp speculation scheme.

3. Frank Abagnale Jr.: Famous for his life story depicted in the movie "Catch Me If You Can," Abagnale posed as a pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer, cashing millions of dollars' worth of forged checks.

4. Raj Rajaratnam: The founder of the Galleon Group, Rajaratnam was convicted of insider trading and served an 11-year prison sentence.

5. Elizabeth Holmes: The founder of Theranos, Holmes was accused of defrauding investors by claiming her company had developed revolutionary blood-testing technology, when in reality, the technology was not as advanced as she claimed.

 The most recent fraudster among the examples I provided is Elizabeth Holmes, who was convicted of fraud in 2021. Holmes was the founder of Theranos, a health technology company that claimed to have developed a revolutionary blood-testing technology that could perform hundreds of tests with just a few drops of blood. However, it was later revealed that the technology was not as advanced as Holmes claimed, and the company was using traditional methods to perform the tests.

Holmes was able to succeed for a time because she was a charismatic and persuasive leader who was able to attract high-profile investors, including media mogul Rupert Murdoch and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. She also made numerous appearances on television shows and in magazines, promoting her company and its technology. However, as investigations into Theranos' claims began to surface, it became clear that the company was not delivering on its promises, and Holmes was eventually charged with fraud.

 If Elizabeth Holmes were to operate today, it is possible that she might still be able to attract investors and gain some initial success, but it is less likely that she would be able to get away with her fraud for as long as she did in the past.

One reason for this is that there is now more scrutiny and transparency in the startup and investment world, with a greater emphasis on due diligence and verification of claims. Additionally, social media and the internet have made it easier for information to be shared and for investigations to be conducted more quickly.

In the case of Theranos, one of the key factors that allowed Holmes to succeed for so long was her ability to deceive and manipulate the media. Today, there is a greater awareness of the importance of independent journalism and fact-checking, which could help to prevent similar situations from arising.

Furthermore, regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have become more proactive in investigating and prosecuting fraudulent activities. This increased oversight could help to deter potential fraudsters and protect investors.

Overall, while it is still possible for fraudsters to succeed in today's environment, there are now more checks and balances in place to prevent and detect fraud, making it less likely that a fraud like Theranos would be able to operate for as long as it did in the past.
