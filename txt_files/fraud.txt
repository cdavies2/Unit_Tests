 I am sorry, I cannot provide a comprehensive list, but here are a few examples of well-known U.S. fraudsters:

1. Bernie Madoff: He is perhaps the most infamous financial fraudster in U.S. history. Madoff ran a Ponzi scheme that defrauded thousands of investors out of billions of dollars.

2. Charles Ponzi: Known for the Ponzi scheme that bears his name, Ponzi promised investors a 50% return on their investment in just 90 days. He was eventually exposed and sentenced to prison.

3. Frank Abagnale: Famous for his life story as portrayed in the movie "Catch Me If You Can," Abagnale posed as a pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer, cashing millions of dollars' worth of forged checks.

4. Jordan Belfort: Known as the "Wolf of Wall Street," Belfort ran a stock market manipulation scheme in the 1990s. He was sentenced to prison and later wrote a memoir about his experiences.

5. Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling: The former CEO and COO of Enron, respectively, were involved in a massive accounting fraud that led to the collapse of the energy company and cost thousands of investors their savings.

 The most recent fraudster among the examples I provided is Jordan Belfort, who was active in the 1990s. Belfort's success was due to his charismatic personality and ability to persuade investors to buy into his stock schemes. He used high-pressure sales tactics and promised unrealistic returns to attract clients, which helped him amass a fortune before his fraud was exposed.

It's important to note that fraudsters can operate at any time, and new cases of fraud are constantly emerging. The methods and tactics used by fraudsters can evolve over time, making it essential for individuals and organizations to stay vigilant and informed about potential scams.
mistral : 
 If Jordan Belfort were to operate today, it is difficult to say with certainty whether he would still succeed. However, it is likely that he would face more obstacles and scrutiny than he did in the 1990s.

Today, there are more regulations and oversight in the financial industry, which makes it harder for fraudsters to operate undetected. Additionally, the internet and social media have made it easier for people to research and verify information, making it more difficult for fraudsters to deceive potential victims.

Furthermore, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory bodies have become more proactive in investigating and prosecuting fraud cases. This increased scrutiny and enforcement can help deter potential fraudsters and make it more difficult for those who do engage in fraud to succeed.

That being said, fraudsters are always finding new ways to evade detection, so it is important for individuals and organizations to remain vigilant and to educate themselves about the latest scams and fraud tactics.  â€‹

Here are some well-known examples of successful U.S. fraudsters:

1. **Bernard Madoff**: Known for running the largest Ponzi scheme in history, Madoff defrauded thousands of investors out of approximately $65 billion. He was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 150 years in prison.
2. **Enron's Jeffrey Skilling and Kenneth Lay**: These two executives were involved in a massive accounting scandal that led to the collapse of energy company Enron in 2001. Skilling was sentenced to 24 years in prison, while Lay died before his sentencing.
3. **Jordan Belfort**: A stockbroker and founder of L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin, Belfort was involved in a pump-and-dump scheme that defrauded investors out of millions. His story was immortalized in the film "The Wolf of Wall Street." He was sentenced to 4 years in prison.
4. **Charles Ponzi**: An Italian immigrant, Ponzi is famous for creating the "Ponzi scheme," where returns are paid to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors, rather than from profit earned. He was arrested in 1920 and sentenced to 5 years in prison.
5. **Dennis Kozlowski**: The former CEO of Tyco International, Kozlowski was convicted of embezzling over $150 million from the company and using it for personal expenses, including a $6,000 shower curtain. He was sentenced to 8 to 25 years in prison.
6. **Allen Stanford**: A financier and cricket enthusiast, Stanford was convicted of running a $7 billion Ponzi scheme through his Stanford Financial Group. He was sentenced to 110 years in prison.
7. **Martin Shkreli**: A pharmaceutical executive, Shkreli was convicted of securities fraud related to his hedge fund and pharmaceutical company. He was sentenced to 7 years in prison.

These individuals are a few examples of successful U.S. fraudsters who were eventually caught and brought to justice. Their stories serve as cautionary tales about the dangers of white-collar crime and the importance of financial regulation.

The most recent fraudster I mentioned is **Martin Shkreli**, who was convicted of securities fraud in 2017. Shkreli, also known as the "Pharma Bro," was a pharmaceutical executive and founder of Retrophin and Turing Pharmaceuticals.

Shkreli's success as a fraudster can be attributed to several factors:

1. **Lack of transparency**: Shkreli's hedge fund, MSMB Capital Management, was a private fund that didn't require the same level of disclosure as public companies. This lack of transparency made it easier for him to conceal his fraudulent activities.
2. **Complex financial instruments**: Shkreli used complex financial instruments, such as options and securities, to disguise his losses and mislead investors. This complexity made it difficult for investors to understand the true nature of his investments.
3. **Charisma and confidence**: Shkreli was known for his charismatic personality and confidence, which helped him attract investors and build trust. He was able to convince investors that his investments were sound and that he had a unique understanding of the pharmaceutical industry.
4. **Regulatory weaknesses**: At the time, there were weaknesses in the regulatory framework that allowed Shkreli to operate with relative impunity. He was able to take advantage of these weaknesses to conceal his fraudulent activities.

However, Shkreli's success was ultimately short-lived. He was arrested in 2015 and charged with securities fraud. In 2017, he was convicted of two counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. He was sentenced to 7 years in prison and fined $75,000.

Shkreli's case highlights the importance of strong regulatory oversight, transparency, and due diligence in preventing fraudulent activities. It also serves as a reminder that even charismatic and confident individuals can engage in fraudulent behavior, and that investors should always be cautious and do their research before investing.

If Martin Shkreli were to operate today, it's unlikely that he would succeed in the same way. There have been significant changes in the regulatory landscape, advancements in technology, and increased awareness among investors and the general public that would make it more difficult for him to carry out his fraudulent activities.

Here are some measures that would likely prevent or detect Shkreli's type of fraud today:

1. **Enhanced regulatory oversight**: Regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) have increased their scrutiny of hedge funds and pharmaceutical companies. Stricter regulations, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, have been implemented to improve transparency and accountability.
2. **Improved auditing and accounting standards**: Auditing and accounting standards have become more robust, making it more difficult for companies to manipulate financial statements and conceal fraudulent activities.
3. **Advanced technological tools**: Technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics are being used to detect and prevent fraud. These tools can identify patterns and anomalies in financial data, making it harder for fraudsters to hide their activities.
4. **Increased transparency and disclosure**: Companies are now required to disclose more information about their financials, operations, and governance. This increased transparency makes it easier for investors and regulators to identify potential red flags.
5. **Whistleblower protections**: Whistleblower programs and protections have been strengthened, encouraging individuals to come forward and report suspicious activities.
6. **Social media and online scrutiny**: Social media and online platforms have increased scrutiny of public figures and companies. Any suspicious activity or irregularities can quickly become public knowledge, making it harder for fraudsters to operate undetected.
7. **Anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations**: AML and KYC regulations have become more stringent, making it more difficult for fraudsters to launder money or conceal their identities.
8. **Collaboration between regulators and law enforcement**: Regulatory bodies and law enforcement agencies are now working more closely together to share information and coordinate efforts to detect and prosecute fraud.

Some specific measures that might have prevented or detected Shkreli's fraud include:

1. **SEC's Investment Adviser Registration Requirements**: Shkreli's hedge fund, MSMB Capital Management, would have been required to register with the SEC, which would have subjected it to greater scrutiny.
2. ** FINRA's Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE)**: TRACE is a system that requires broker-dealers to report trade data, which can help detect and prevent insider trading and other forms of market manipulation.
3. **The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) Code**: PhRMA, a trade organization, has implemented a code of conduct that promotes transparency and ethics in the pharmaceutical industry.
4. **State and federal laws**: Laws such as the False Claims Act and state-level laws, like New York's Martin Act, provide prosecutors with tools to pursue fraud cases and hold individuals accountable.

While it's impossible to eliminate the risk of fraud entirely, these measures have made it more difficult for individuals like Martin Shkreli to succeed in their fraudulent activities.
