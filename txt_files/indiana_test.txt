 I can provide some examples of infamous American bank robbers. Here are a few:

1. John Dillinger: Known as "Public Enemy No. 1" during the Great Depression, Dillinger robbed banks and committed other crimes from 1933 to 1934.

2. Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow: This notorious duo, along with their gang, committed numerous robberies, murders, and other crimes in the 1930s.

3. Jesse James: A notorious outlaw and gang leader in the post-Civil War era, James and his brother, Frank James, were known for their bank and train robberies.

4. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid: This pair, along with their Wild Bunch gang, were known for their train and bank robberies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

5. Willie Sutton: Known for his quote, "Why do I rob banks? Because that's where the money is," Sutton was a prolific bank robber in the mid-20th century.

6. Alvin Karpis: As the leader of the Ma Barker Gang, Karpis was one of the most wanted criminals in the United States during the 1930s.

7. Charles Arthur "Pretty Boy" Floyd: Known for his good looks and charisma, Floyd was a bank robber and gangster during the Great Depression.

8. Baby Face Nelson: A violent criminal and bank robber, Nelson was a member of John Dillinger's gang.

9. The Dalton Gang: This family of bank robbers, led by Grat and Bob Dalton, was active in the late 19th century.

10. The Hole in the Wall Gang: Named after their signature method of escaping after a robbery, this gang, led by Butch Cassidy, was active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

 The actions of the last bank robber I mentioned, the Hole in the Wall Gang, were the most recent among the robbers I listed. The Hole in the Wall Gang was active from the late 1800s to the early 1900s.

The Hole in the Wall Gang was successful due to their meticulous planning, use of disguises, and their ability to escape quickly after committing a robbery. They were also known for their use of a "hole in the wall" to gain entry to banks and avoid detection. Additionally, they often targeted smaller banks in rural areas, which may have had less security than larger urban banks.
mistral : 
 The security measures faced by the bank robbers I mentioned were significantly different from those in use today. In the early 20th century, banks often had minimal security measures, such as simple locks on the doors and limited surveillance. The robbers often used simple tools, such as drills or explosives, to gain entry to banks.

In contrast, modern banks have much more sophisticated security measures in place, such as advanced surveillance systems, alarms, and armed guards. Additionally, banks now use electronic systems, such as automated teller machines (ATMs) and online banking, which make it more difficult for robbers to access cash.

Newer tactics may be more appealing to bank robbers because they are less risky and offer a higher potential payoff. For example, cybercrime, such as hacking into bank accounts or stealing sensitive information, can be done from the comfort of one's own home and can potentially yield a larger payoff than a traditional bank robbery. Additionally, cybercrime is less likely to result in physical harm or capture by law enforcement.

Another reason for the shift towards cybercrime is that it is becoming increasingly difficult for traditional bank robbers to find vulnerable targets. Banks have significantly increased their security measures in response to the actions of past robbers, making it more difficult for them to successfully rob a bank. As a result, many bank robbers have turned to cybercrime as a way to bypass these security measures and access cash.
