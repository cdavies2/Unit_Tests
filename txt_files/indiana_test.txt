1. John Dillinger: Known as "Public Enemy No. 1" during the Great Depression, Dillinger robbed banks and committed other crimes from 1933 to 1934.

2. Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow: This notorious duo, along with their gang, committed numerous robberies, murders, and other crimes in the 1930s.

5. Willie Sutton: Active in the 1930s and 1940s, Sutton was known for his numerous bank robberies. When asked why he robbed banks, he reportedly replied, "Because that's where the money is."

6. Alvin Karpis: Known as "Creepy Karpis," he was a member of the Ma Barker gang and was one of the longest-serving prisoners in the federal prison system.

7. Charles Arthur "Pretty Boy" Floyd: Active during the Great Depression, Floyd was known for his bank robberies and was considered a Robin Hood figure by some.

 The actions of the most recent bank robber on the list I provided were those of Donald "D.B." Cooper, who hijacked a commercial airplane and parachuted with a ransom in 1971. However, it's important to note that his case remains unsolved, and it's unclear whether he survived the jump or not.

As for why Cooper was successful in his robbery, there are a few factors that contributed to his success:

1. Planning and preparation: Cooper had researched the airline's security measures and knew the flight route and schedule. He also had a detailed plan for the hijacking and ransom demand.

2. Timing: Cooper chose to hijack a flight during a time when airline security was relatively lax, and there was less scrutiny on passengers.

3. Lack of technology: In 1971, there was no widespread use of metal detectors or other advanced security measures at airports, making it easier for Cooper to board the plane with a weapon.

4. Cooper's demeanor: Cooper was calm and professional during the hijacking, which helped to keep the situation under control and avoid a violent confrontation with the crew or passengers.

5. The ransom demand: Cooper's ransom demand was for $200,000 in $20 bills, which was a significant amount of money at the time but not an impossible sum for the airline to come up with. The demand was also specific and reasonable, which may have helped to expedite the payment process.

6. Cooper's disappearance: After parachuting from the plane with the ransom money, Cooper disappeared and was never found. This added an element of mystery to the case and made it difficult for authorities to track him down.

 The security measures faced by Donald "D.B." Cooper in 1971 were significantly different from those in place today. Here are some key differences:

1. Airport security: In 1971, there were no metal detectors or X-ray machines at airports to screen passengers and their luggage. Today, passengers are required to go through metal detectors and have their carry-on luggage screened with X-ray machines.

2. Airplane security: In 1971, airplane cockpits were not reinforced, and hijackers could easily gain access to the cockpit. Today, cockpits are reinforced and can only be accessed with a key or a biometric identification system.

3. Law enforcement response: In 1971, law enforcement agencies were not as coordinated or well-equipped to respond to airplane hijackings as they are today. Today, there are specialized units such as the Federal Air Marshal Service and the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team that are trained to respond to airplane hijackings.

4. Communication: In 1971, communication between the hijacker and authorities was limited, and it was difficult to track the plane's location. Today, there are satellite tracking systems and real-time communication between the plane and ground control, making it easier to track the plane and coordinate a response.

5. Public awareness: In 1971, the public was not as aware of the dangers of airplane hijackings as they are today. Today, there is a greater emphasis on security and awareness, which may make it more difficult for hijackers to carry out their plans.

As for why newer tactics might be more appealing, it's important to note that the motivations for criminal activity can vary widely. However, some potential reasons include:

1. Increased security measures: As security measures have become more sophisticated, it may be more challenging for criminals to carry out traditional crimes such as bank robberies or hijackings. This may push them to seek out new opportunities or methods.

2. Technological advancements: New technologies can provide opportunities for criminals to commit crimes in new ways. For example, cybercrime has become a significant issue in recent years, with criminals using technology to steal sensitive information, commit fraud, and extort money.

3. Changing societal norms: As society evolves, so do the motivations and methods of criminals. For example, some criminals may be motivated by political or ideological beliefs, while others may be driven by personal grievances or a desire for notoriety.

4. Economic factors: Economic instability or inequality can create opportunities for criminal activity, as people may turn to crime out of desperation or a desire to improve their financial situation.

5. Globalization: The increasing interconnectedness of the world can create new opportunities for criminal activity, as criminals can operate across borders and take advantage of weak links in the global security system.

Overall, while security measures have become more sophisticated over time, criminals continue to adapt and find new ways to commit crimes. It's important for law enforcement agencies to stay vigilant and continue to evolve their strategies to stay ahead of criminal activity.
