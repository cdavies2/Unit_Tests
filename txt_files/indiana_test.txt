 I can provide some examples of infamous American bank robbers. Here are a few:

1. John Dillinger: Known as "Public Enemy No. 1" during the Great Depression, Dillinger robbed banks and committed other crimes from 1933 to 1934.

2. Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow: This notorious duo, along with their gang, committed numerous robberies, murders, and other crimes in the 1930s.

3. Jesse James: A notorious outlaw and gang leader in the post-Civil War era, James and his brother, Frank James, were known for their bank and train robberies.

4. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid: This pair, along with their Wild Bunch gang, were known for their train and bank robberies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

5. Willie Sutton: Active in the 1930s and 1940s, Sutton was known for his numerous bank robberies. When asked why he robbed banks, he reportedly replied, "Because that's where the money is."

6. Alvin Karpis: Known as "Creepy Karpis," he was a member of the Ma Barker gang and was one of the longest-serving prisoners in the federal prison system.

7. Charles Arthur "Pretty Boy" Floyd: Active during the Great Depression, Floyd was known for his bank robberies and was considered a Robin Hood figure by some.

8. Baby Face Nelson: A violent criminal, Nelson was a member of John Dillinger's gang and was known for his bank robberies and shootouts with law enforcement.

 The actions of the last robber I mentioned, Baby Face Nelson, were the most recent among the robbers I listed. Nelson was active during the 1930s, specifically from 1933 to 1934.

Nelson was successful in part because he was a skilled marksman and was willing to use violence to escape from law enforcement. He was also a member of John Dillinger's gang, which was notorious for its bank robberies and evasion of the law. Nelson was known for his ability to change his appearance quickly, making it difficult for authorities to identify him.

However, it's important to note that Nelson's criminal career was short-lived. He was killed in a shootout with FBI agents in 1934. Despite his successes, his violent and unpredictable behavior ultimately led to his downfall.

 The security measures and tactics used by the bank robbers I mentioned, such as John Dillinger, Bonnie and Clyde, Jesse James, Butch Cassidy, and Baby Face Nelson, were significantly different from those used today. At that time, banks were not as heavily fortified as they are today, and there were fewer surveillance cameras and other security technologies.

In contrast, modern banks have multiple layers of security, including:

1. Physical security measures: Banks have reinforced walls, vaults, and other physical barriers to protect against theft.
2. Surveillance cameras: Banks have numerous cameras both inside and outside the building to monitor activity and deter crime.
3. Alarm systems: Banks have sophisticated alarm systems that can alert authorities to intruders or other suspicious activity.
4. Cash handling procedures: Banks have strict procedures for handling cash, including counting and transporting money, to minimize the risk of theft.
5. Electronic security systems: Banks use electronic security systems, such as biometric scanners and access control systems, to limit access to sensitive areas.

Newer tactics may be more appealing to criminals because they are designed to bypass or exploit these modern security measures. For example, cybercrime has become a significant threat to banks, with criminals using hacking and other digital techniques to steal money and sensitive information. Additionally, some criminals may still resort to traditional methods of bank robbery, but they may use more sophisticated tools and tactics to avoid detection or evade capture.

Overall, the evolution of security measures and tactics in the banking industry has made it more difficult for criminals to successfully rob banks, but it has also led to the emergence of new types of crime, such as cybercrime.
