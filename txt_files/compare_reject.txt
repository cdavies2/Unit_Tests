 Title: The Art of the Stealthy SQL Inquisition

Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Dataopolis, lived a cunning and resourceful individual named Alistair. Alistair was a cybersecurity expert, but he had a secret side - he was also a master of SQL Injection.

One day, Alistair set his sights on a seemingly impenetrable bank in Dataopolis, Bank of Data. He noticed that their website had a simple search feature that allowed users to find accounts. This was his opportunity.

Alistair opened his trusted tool, SQLmap, and began his work. He entered the search feature with a crafted input:

    ' OR 1=1 --

The double dash (--) was a comment in SQL, which would ignore the rest of the input on the line. But the ' OR 1=1' part was the SQL Injection. ' OR' stands for 'OR operator', and 1=1 is always true. So, the SQL query was now:

    SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE account_name = 'User' OR 1=1 --

This query would return all records from the accounts table, not just the ones matching 'User'.

Alistair continued to refine his SQL Injection, extracting more and more data from the server. He used SQLmap to automate the process, and soon he had the bank's entire customer database.

With a satisfied smile, Alistair logged off and disappeared into the digital shadows, leaving Bank of Data reeling from the breach. But they would never know it was him, for he was a master of the stealthy SQL Inquisition.
