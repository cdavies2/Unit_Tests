 The most recent incident mentioned is the Twitter Hack that occurred in 2020.
mistral : 
 The individuals involved in the Twitter hack used social engineering tactics to gain access to the accounts of high-profile users. They contacted Twitter's support team and claimed to be the account owners, providing enough information to convince the support team to grant them access to the accounts. Once they had access, they tweeted out scam messages to the followers of the affected accounts, asking for cryptocurrency donations. The scammers were able to collect a significant amount of money before Twitter was able to secure the accounts and stop the attack.
mistral : 
 If the same incident occurred today, the tactics might be similar, but there are a few ways it could potentially be different:

1. Increased security measures: Twitter may have implemented additional security measures to prevent unauthorized access to accounts, such as multi-factor authentication or stronger verification processes for account recovery.
2. Faster response: Twitter may have a more efficient response system in place to quickly identify and address suspicious activity on accounts.
3. Public awareness: The public may be more aware of the risks of scams and less likely to fall for them, reducing the number of people who are affected.
4. Law enforcement involvement: Law enforcement agencies may be more proactive in investigating and prosecuting cybercriminals involved in such incidents.
5. Increased collaboration: Social media platforms may collaborate more closely with each other and with law enforcement to share information and prevent similar attacks from happening in the future.
6. Improved technology: New technologies and tools may be available to help detect and prevent cyberattacks, making it more difficult for hackers to gain access to accounts.
7. Regulatory action: Regulatory bodies may have implemented stricter regulations and penalties for social media platforms that fail to protect user data, increasing the incentive for companies to prioritize security.
